#### A digital Lbrary. Where people can read books on the go.

## **What are we trying to build?**

#### We’re trying to build a digital library where people can read and learn from the books of any kind. Users will be able to register , login and read books. Admin can perform all the function with additional authority to add, delete and update Books & Authors and can also see details of all the users.

## **What technologies and packages have we used?**

#### **NodeJS:** Complete Backend is implemented in NodeJs

#### **ExpressJS:** Handling the requests and responses for the API.

#### **MongoDB:** For storing user information and dynamic telemetry data.

#### **JWT:** Handling  authentication using JWT (jsonwebtokens)

#### **bcryptjs:** For hashing pssword




## **Room for improvement:**
### Integration of payments,user can share books, user can published there own books.
#### Angular/React Native Web based frontend for the application. And displaying the data in graphs. Currently, ejs are making the code bloated for a simple implementation. By using Angular/RNW/ReactJS ‘es reusable component can make our job easier.
